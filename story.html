---------------------------------------------
[INT. DESERT BASE – NIGHT]
The wind howls like a dying machine. The soldier—early 20s, sunburned, still wearing headphones—sits alone, scrolling through old voice memos.

<b>SOLDIER (V.O.)</b>
(quietly)
I used to think coming home would mean peace. But the war follows you. It gets in your skin. Makes a new version of you.

[FLASHBACK – INT. BEDROOM – YEARS AGO]
Prince hands Marco a broken aux cord. They're surrounded by posters, loose sketches, and an unfinished track.

<b>PRINCE</b>
You ever think we’re supposed to burn out just to make something?

<b>MARCO</b>
We already did. That’s why the songs sound like this.

---------------------------------------------
[INT. BUS – SUNSET]
The soldier, now returned home, watches graffiti blur past. Everyone's moving. He’s still.

<b>SOLDIER (V.O.)</b>
It’s hard to leave California. It’s harder when it pretends it never knew you. Like it never kissed you goodbye.

---------------------------------------------
[INT. STUDIO – PRESENT DAY]
Old friends yell over distorted bass. The laptop glows. The soldier finally speaks into the mic.

<b>SOLDIER</b>
(for the record)
My name’s not important. But this… this mixtape? This is how I survived it all.
