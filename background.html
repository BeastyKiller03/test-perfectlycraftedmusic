    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Marco Maria and Prince Youngblood are a creative duo blending sound, visual art, and DIY punk aesthetics.
      The two met at a party, barely interacting and only following each other on socials. After a few
      meetups, Prince discovered Marco made music and that same day made a song together. The relationship wasn't yet
      solidified until Coachella 2022, where the two randomly saw that they were both at the event and met up.
      Marco is the Vocals, The Production, the Director while Prince is the Muse, The inspiration, The Heart,
      and the Fashion Designer.
