  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Marco Maria and Prince Youngblood are a creative duo blending sound, visual art, and DIY punk aesthetics.  
    They met at a party, barely interacting, but followed each other on socials.  
    A few casual meetups led to their first song.  
    <br><br>
    Their friendship solidified at Coachella 2022, where a random link-up sparked something real.  
    Marco is the vocals, production, and creative director.  
    Prince is the muse, the inspiration, the heart, and the fashion mind.
