    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Marco Maria and Prince Youngblood are a creative duo redefining the norm by blending sound, visual art, fashion, and DIY punk aesthetics. They first crossed paths at a party, barely speaking but followed each other on socials. Their connection slowly grew through a series of casual moments: being extras in an Ab-Soul music video, bumping into each other at a Halloween party, and Prince crashing at Marco’s place for Rolling Loud, where he discovered Marco made music. That same night, they recorded their first track together.

      Their bond solidified at Coachella 2022 (the week Frank Ocean performed), where a random encounter turned into something real. From that point on, it was clear they needed to combine their creative energy, thus, :pm was born. They started with remixes and DJing friends’ parties before dropping their debut project, “EMP” — a mixtape packed with rough demos and chaotic, distorted beats.

      Marco handles vocals, production, and direction. Prince brings the vision, the fashion, and the emotional core. Together, they’re building something uniquely theirs. The duo recently released their latest single, “ANG3L,” accompanied by self-directed visuals and are currently working on their next EP, soon to be announced.
