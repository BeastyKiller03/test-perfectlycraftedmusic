    Something was always off about the silence between their calls. Not just distance—but interference.
    James started to notice the patterns: the static in old voicemails, the sudden rain on clear sky nights, the
    way his name echoed back in empty buildings.

    Star had warned him, once, during a dream or something that felt like one:

    "You’re not remembering right. That night at the bar? It didn’t happen the way you think."

    Ever since the breakup, little signs crept in. Emails dated 2043. Street names blinking into numbers.
    The same couple walking past him three times in the same hour.

    James writes everything down now. Everything he remembers.
    Because he’s scared that if he stops, he’ll forget her.

    Or worse...

    That he never knew her at all.
